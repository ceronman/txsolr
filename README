--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the tests it's recommended to use Solr 1.4. Download Solr from here:

http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

Run the example server that comes in the zip following the Solr tutorial:

http://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html

* IMPORTANT: Never run the tests with a production Solr Server. The tests could
             leave test documents in the index or important data could be
             deleted.

* NOTE: The test need a schema similar to the one that comes with the example

Tu run the tests, be sure txsolr is in your current path and run:

$ trial txsolr
